<p id="testLine">It's not much but I've always had quite a few interests, some were studious interests, some were physical, some where philosophical and some were even down right dumb. I've tried to compile a group of images that best reflect my interests and hobbies. Like the type of vaction spots i'd like, the type of animals I like, the type of jokes I find funny, and so on.. From here on out im just typing to fill the gap. So i'll just repeat a long sentence that uses many words to show the complexitites of the absolute bs that I am typing.  Maybe if I switch it up here and there you would never be able to tell the difference even if you tried to skim through it, let's see ladies and gentlemen.
